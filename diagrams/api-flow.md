# API Flow 

This document stipulates the workflow responsibilities taken at each step at a high level ladder diagram between the three components of the system:

* Web Application Server
* Buildserver
* Database

## Application Workflow

1. User authenticates on internal web page
1. Once authenticated user account on local database is created or current account has login process logged
1. If first login, create user hash for ID and store Oauth2 token in account
1. Welcome screen presented
1. User chooses a lab to launch
1. Web server API communicates with a backend API that will tell our buildserver to launch the required lab via terraform
1. This includes setting up internal authentication using Vault for system Proxmox API secrets
1. Proxmox API communicates with Web Application API showing progress deploy meter (metrics can be gathered internally from Promox API and shared via API)
1. Buildserver API will issue a terraform apply command. This requires individual directories per user  and sub-directories per each lab to be created We would pre-create this upon account creation. 
1.	Once application is deployed tutorial steps and screen will come up
  i. Session is logged in the database
1.	Upon completion of the lab (submit button is hit) and grading script grades the lab – value stored in
1.	Upon FINISH/RESET button being hit Web application API will trigger buildserver API to issue terraform destroy command

        Database->>WebApp: User Account does not exist, creating account. 
        Note right of Database: Buildserver copying Terraform <br /> lab templates to user account directory

        WebApp-->>Buildserver: Launch Selected Lab
        Buildserver-->>WebApp: Selected Lab launched via: terraform apply command
        Buildserver-->>WebApp: Send updates of lab deployment
        Buildserver-->>WebApp: Send update that deployment of lab is complete

end
