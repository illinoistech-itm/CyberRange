# Team 01 Mayflower Compact

Ana, Cedric, Tracy, Thein, and Henry

Roles: Project Manager, Developer 1, Developer 2, UI/UX, IT Operations and Security

We will rotate every sprint.

Sprint 1:

PM - Tracy
Dev 1 - Ana
Dev 2 - Cedric
UI/UX - Henry
IT Ops - Thein

## How work will flow

Project Manager will go over tasks that need to be completed for this current sprint. Each team member will provide suggestions/problems/ideas in regards to their role. 

## Communication rules and methods

We will use Discord as our primary method of communication. Each team member must notify whenever they have made changes so that other team members can pull (and avoid conflicts). 

## Consequences

- If a team member is being unresponsive (2 days of no reply), Professor Hajek will be notified of inactivity. 

- If a team member does not complete their tasks, without notification/discussion with the whole team, then Professor Hajek will be notified and they have to buy everyone a donut.

## Restoration methods

Depending on the issue, we will write down what the issue is, write down what the potential
solutions are, and vote on the solution. In other words, the Avengers will assemble and go through deliberation on what would best benefit the group.
